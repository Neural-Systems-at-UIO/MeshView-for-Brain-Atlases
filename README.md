# MeshView for Brain Atlases
Mesh viewer with solid slicing and point cloud support.
MeshView is one of several tools developed by the Human Brain Project (HBP) with the aim of facilitating brain atlas based analysis and integration of experimental data and knowledge about the human and rodent brain. MeshView is a web application for real-time 3D display of surface mesh data representing structural parcellations from volumetric atlases, such as the Waxholm Space Atlas of the Sprague Dawley Rat Brain.

Forked from https://github.com/Tevemadar/meshview-demo for bundling additional atlases and releasing on OKD.
